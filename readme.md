# Property Filter Test - The Family Chemist

## Overview
This test involves creating a property filtering system using Object-Oriented PHP. You are provided with a JSON file containing data about various properties. Your task is to implement functionality that allows users to filter these properties based on specific criteria.

## Requirements

1. **Proximity Filter**:
   - Implement a feature to find properties within a 5-mile radius of a given postcode. You will need to integrate an external service or use a formula to calculate distances based on latitude and longitude.

2. **Amenities Filter**:
   - Allow users to filter properties by amenities. The filter should support multiple selections.

3. **Price Filter**:
   - Implement a filter to allow users to select properties within a certain price range.

4. **Room Filter**:
   - Provide options to filter properties by the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and reception rooms.

5. **Incomplete Data**
   - Resolve an issue with the dataset

## Data
The `data.json` file contains entries for various properties, each with details like address, amenities, number of rooms, and an image name. Use this data to populate your filters and results dynamically.

## Implementation
- Use Object-Oriented native PHP to structure your application.
- Ensure your solution is efficient and scales well with larger datasets.
- Comment your code appropriately to explain key decisions and complex logic.
- Please complete the UI however you see fit. 

## Submission
- Your final submission should include all source files and any additional instructions needed to run your application.
- Ensure your application is fully functional and meets all the above requirements.

Good luck!
